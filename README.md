# Pomodoro-Clock-
 A Pomodoro clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web application that helps users manage their time more effectively. The application typically consists of a timer interface where users can set a work duration and a break duration. The timer counts down the time for the user to focus on their work, followed by a break period to rest their mind and recharge.

Here is a possible description for building a Pomodoro clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML:

Create a container element to hold the Pomodoro clock interface.
Add an input field for users to set the work duration.
Add an input field for users to set the break duration.
Create a button to start the Pomodoro timer.
Create a timer display to show the countdown time.
CSS:

Style the container element to position it on the page and set its width and height.
Add styles for the input fields and button to make them visually appealing and easy to use.
Style the timer display to make it clear and easy to read.
JavaScript:

Create variables to hold the work duration, break duration, and current time remaining.
Add an event listener to the start button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
When the start button is clicked, start the timer countdown for the work duration.
When the work duration is completed, switch to the break duration and start the break timer countdown.
When the break duration is completed, switch back to the work duration and restart the cycle.
Create a function to update the timer display with the current time remaining.
Add a pause and reset functionality to allow users to pause or reset the Pomodoro timer as needed.
